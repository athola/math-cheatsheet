"""Python → Lean 4 bridge for Stage 2 formal verification (issue #32).

Takes a Python-side implication outcome (typically a ``PredictionResult``
plus the underlying ``CounterexampleMagma``) and emits a self-contained
Lean 4 source snippet that restates the finding in a form ``lean`` can
type-check. The initial scope covers FALSE implications witnessed by a
finite 2-element magma; larger carriers and TRUE-side proof skeletons
can follow the same pattern.

The emitted source is intentionally minimal scaffolding:

- One ``def`` for the binary operation, defined by ``match`` on the pair
  of indices so the Cayley table is visible in the source.
- Carrier is ``Fin n`` (standard Mathlib choice for small finite types).
- One placeholder ``example : True := by trivial`` so the snippet
  type-checks.

IMPORTANT — this bridge does NOT produce verified output. The placeholder
body is a tautology: ``trivial`` proves ``True`` regardless of the magma or
the equations, so a snippet that "type-checks" says nothing about whether H
fails to imply T. The Cayley table is rendered faithfully, but the
implication itself is unproven. Do not describe this output as "verified" or
"machine-checked"; it is a scaffold awaiting a real proof.

For a fully-proven example of the intended end state, see
``lean/EquationalTheories/Invariants.lean`` (``idemp_not_implies_comm``),
which discharges ``¬ implies …`` from an explicit ``Fin 2`` countermodel.
Upgrading this generator to emit such a ``theorem … := by decide`` (by also
emitting the equations as Lean propositions) is tracked as backlog issue O1
from the PR #57 review.

Callers intending to verify with ``lean --stdin`` should concatenate the
snippet after whatever imports they need (typically just
``import Mathlib.Data.Fin.Basic``).
